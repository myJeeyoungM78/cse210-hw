Articulate the principle of version control

    Version control is a system that records changes to files. It allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously.
    Highlight a benefit of Version control, Git/GitHub, have that 1. Tracks the history of changes. 2. Edit. 3. Projects together. 
    4. The projet can be recovered, etc.
    Also, every developer can review project history to find out:
        * which changes were made?
        * Who made the changes?
        * When were the changes made?
        * Why were changes needed?
    Developers clone the repository to their local machines
    The command used in version control are git init, git clone, git checkout, git add ., git commit, etc.
